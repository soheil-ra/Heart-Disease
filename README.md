**Overview**<br>
---
This project classifies whether a person is suffering from heart disease or not, by applying 3 common Machine Learning techniques, Logistic Regression, Random Forest Classifier, and K-Nearest Neighbor Classifier.<br>

**Goals**<br>
---
The achivement for this project are:<br><br>
**1. Preparing Data:** This section includes, Cleaning, Exploring and Visulizing data.<br>
**2. Proposing Methods & Experiments:** Selecting three commonly Supervised Machine Learning methodes and comparing the outcomes upon existing data for predicting heart diseases.<br>

**Motivation & Background**<br>
---

Looking at the report from Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) report about heart diseases in the United States was a motivation to choose this subject for my study. According to  CDC, Heart disease is the leading cause of death for men, women, and people of most racial and ethnic groups in the United States. One person dies every 36 seconds in the United States from cardiovascular disease. About 655,000 Americans die from heart disease each year—that’s 1 in every 4 deaths. Heart disease costs the United States about $219 billion each year from 2014 to 2015. This includes the cost of health care services, medicines, and lost productivity due to death.<br><br>

**Data**<br>
---
The dataset have been collected from Kaggle (https://www.kaggle.com/sid321axn/heart-statlog-cleveland-hungary-final), consisting of 1190 records of patients from US, UK, Switzerland and Hungary having 11 features and 1 target variable representing as follow:<br>

**1. age -** Age of patients in years<br>
**2. sex -** Sex of patients, having value 1 as a male and 0 as a female<br>
**3. cp -** Chest pain type<br>
**4. trestbps -** Resting blood pressure (in mm Hg on admission to the hospital)<br>
**5. chol -** Serum cholesterol (in mg/dl)<br>
**6. fbs -** Fasting blood sugar (in mg/dl)<br>
**7. restecg -** Resting electrocardiographic results<br>
**8. thalach -** Maximum heart rate achieved (in beats per minutes)(bpm)<br>
**9. exang -** Exercise induced angina<br>
**10. oldpeak -** ST depression induced by exercise relative to rest<br>
**11. slope -** The slope of the peak exercise ST segment<br>
**12. diagnosis -** The target cariable with 1 value for having disease and 0 value for not having disease.<br>
